# Book typeset projects


## How to use

### Option 1: The simple way
    To typeset using LaTeX
    
1. Download the zip with the source code
  Do that by clicking on the green button on the top right corner labeled as "CODE", it'll open a menu and there you should select the option "Download Zip".
  
2.   Now you'll need a LaTeX editor and compiler. I recommend using overleaf.com
  It sounds scary, but we'll be using overleaf.com that is free and has a rich text editing option that looks a lot like what we have in ao3, so we should be fine. Any questions feel free to reach out and I'll do my best to answer it.

4.  On the home page, on the left upper corner, click on the green button labeled as "New Project", it'll lead to a menu in which you'll choose the option to "Upload Project". The select the zip file you'll have previously downloaded. If you didn't rename it, it should be named "latex-typeset-main.zip".

4.  Now you'll have available to you the source code for typesetting.
    Please keep in mind that we're sharing with you the entirety of our project, including how the text turned out (inked-raw.pdf) and within the code you'll find the fanfic Inked by Drunkonturpentine. You'll have to replace our text with your own, eventually. But I recommend you play around with Inked first so you can see how each parameter on the code changes the final product. 
    a. First thing to note is to look on the menu on the left side where you'll find FOLDERS that contain the FILES you'll work with. Our folder is Inked-raw.
