# Book typeset projects


## How to use

### Option 1: The simple way
    
1. Download the zip with the source code
  Do that by clicking on the green button on the top right corner labeled as "CODE", it'll open a menu and there you should select the option "Download Zip".
  
2.   Now you'll need a LaTeX editor and compiler. I recommend using overleaf.com
  It sounds scary, but we'll be using overleaf.com that has a free version and a rich text editing option that looks a lot like what we have in ao3, so we should be fine. Any questions feel free to reach out and I'll do my best to answer it.

4.  Once you have an account, on the home page, on the left upper corner, click on the green button labeled as "New Project", it'll lead to a menu in which you'll choose the option to "Upload Project". The select the zip file you'll have previously downloaded. If you didn't rename it, it should be named "latex-typeset-main.zip".

4.  Now you'll have available to you the source code for typesetting.
    Please keep in mind that we're sharing with you the entirety of our project, including how the text turned out (inked-raw.pdf) and within the code you'll find the fanfic Inked by Drunkonturpentine. You'll have to replace the text with your own, eventually. But I recommend you play around with Inked first so you can see how each parameter on the code changes the final product. 
    a. First thing to note is to look on the menu on the left side where you'll find FOLDERS that contain the FILES you'll work with. Our folder is Inked-raw. 
    b. Click on the arrow on its left and there you'll find another folder called Figures (that's where you'll keep any image you want to use) and two text files: body.tex and main.tex. 
        body.tex is where the chapters of the fic we'll be stored, if you click on it you'll see that the first thing you'll find is the text for the start of the first chapter. 
        main.tex is where you'll add all the other stuff and make them and the chapters look nice. Pretty much it's here where the magic will happen.
